Appointment Scheduling UI Module
=================================

New UI for appointment scheduling module based on UI/App framework

**Prerequisites:** Before building the mdoule, please make sure that you have setup the following on your machine:  
* Git
* npm
* Bower

Helpful hints:

If the jasmine tests are failing, it may be because your bower components directory is stale.

To fix this, delete `omod/serc/main/webapp/reosurces/scripts/bower_components.openmrs-uicommons` directory and then rerun a maven clean install.
